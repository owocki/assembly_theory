# Wolf Packs: Social Assembly Case Study

## Overview

Wolf packs represent one of the most studied and iconic examples of mammalian social assembly, demonstrating how cooperative behavior, hierarchical organization, and collective intelligence create group capabilities that far exceed individual wolf abilities. This case study examines wolf pack structure as a complex assembly with emergent properties including coordinated hunting, territorial defense, and sophisticated communication systems.
