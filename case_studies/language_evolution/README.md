## Implications for Assembly Theory

### Language as Meta-Assembly System
Language represents a unique class of assembly - one that assembles meaning itself. It demonstrates:

1. **Recursive Self-Assembly**: Language can describe and modify its own structure
2. **Abstract Assembly**: Creates assemblies of pure information without physical substrate
3. **Network Assembly**: Enables collective intelligence through communication networks
4. **Assembly Acceleration**: Dramatically speeds up cultural and technological evolution

### Universal Principles
```
Assembly Theory Insights:
- Information can have assembly structure independent of physical substrate
- Recursive systems can bootstrap unlimited complexity from finite rules
- Cultural transmission creates selection pressures analogous to biological evolution
- Communication systems enable collective problem-solving exceeding individual capacity
```
