# Sardine Schooling Behavior Case Study

## Overview

Sardine schools represent one of nature's most spectacular examples of collective behavior, with millions of individuals moving as a single, coordinated entity. These massive aggregations demonstrate how simple local interactions can produce complex, adaptive group behaviors that enhance survival.

## Assembly Index: 20-60

- **Individual fish**: AI = 20
- **Small shoals (10-100)**: AI = 30
- **Schools (1,000-10,000)**: AI = 40
- **Mega-schools (millions)**: AI = 50
- **Bait balls under predation**: AI = 60

## Key Components

### Sensory Systems
1. **Lateral Line System**
   - Pressure wave detection
   - Neighbor position sensing
   - Flow field information
   - Predator detection

2. **Visual System**
   - Neighbor tracking
   - Predator recognition
   - Light polarization
   - School edge detection

3. **Acoustic Sensing**
   - Sound production
   - Vibration detection
   - Predator acoustic signatures

## Schooling Rules

### Basic Behavioral Rules
1. **Attraction**: Move toward neighbors (>1 body length away)
2. **Alignment**: Match neighbor direction and speed
3. **Repulsion**: Avoid collisions (<1 body length)

### Emergent Properties
- Collective decision-making
- Information transfer waves
- Predator confusion effect
- Hydrodynamic efficiency
- Thermoregulation benefits

## School Structure

### Spatial Organization
```
Nearest Neighbor Distance (NND): 0.5-1.0 body lengths
              ↓
Packing structure: Cubic lattice
              ↓
Density: 1-500 fish/m³
              ↓
Polarization: 0.8-0.95
              ↓
School shape: Ellipsoid/sphere
```

### Dynamic Patterns
- **Cruising**: Parallel swimming
- **Feeding**: Loose aggregation
- **Predator response**: Tight ball
- **Migration**: Column formation

## Information Transfer

### Wave Propagation
- **Speed**: 10-15 meters/second
- **Mechanism**: Visual/lateral line
- **Direction**: Typically inward
- **Amplification**: Increases with depth

### Decision Propagation
```
Initiator fish detect stimulus
            ↓
Local response (5-7 neighbors)
            ↓
Wave formation
            ↓
School-wide response
            ↓
Collective decision
```

## Anti-Predator Behaviors

### Bait Ball Formation
1. **Detection**: Predator approach sensed
2. **Compression**: Inward movement
3. **Rotation**: Continuous circulation
4. **Density**: Maximum packing
5. **Duration**: Until predator departure

for each fish:
    separation = avoid_crowding(neighbors)
    alignment = match_velocity(neighbors)
    cohesion = move_toward_center(neighbors)
    velocity = weighted_sum(separation, alignment, cohesion)
```
