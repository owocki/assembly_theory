# Honeybee Communication: The Dance Language

## Overview

Honeybee communication represents one of the most sophisticated non-human communication systems known to science. Through a combination of dance movements, pheromones, vibrations, and sounds, honeybees convey complex information about resource locations, colony needs, and environmental conditions. The waggle dance, in particular, stands as the only known abstract referential communication system outside of human language.
