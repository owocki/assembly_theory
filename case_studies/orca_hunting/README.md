# Orca Cooperative Hunting Case Study

## Overview

Orca (killer whale) hunting strategies represent some of the most sophisticated cooperative behaviors in the animal kingdom. Different orca populations have developed unique, culturally transmitted hunting techniques tailored to their specific prey and environments, demonstrating remarkable behavioral flexibility and social learning.

## Assembly Index: 60-90

- **Individual hunting**: AI = 60
- **Coordinated group hunting**: AI = 70

## Communication During Hunts

### Acoustic Coordination
- **Clicks**: Echolocation for prey tracking
- **Calls**: Group coordination
- **Silence**: Stealth mode for mammals
- **Dialects**: Population-specific patterns

### Non-Vocal Signals
- Surface behaviors
- Synchronous movements
- Positioning cues
- Speed changes

## Social Learning

### Teaching Mechanisms
1. **Demonstration**
   - Adults perform technique
   - Juveniles observe
   - Repeated exposure

2. **Practice Facilitation**
   - Safe practice opportunities
   - Injured prey provision
   - Gradual skill building

3. **Active Instruction**
   - Pushing juveniles into position
   - Correcting mistakes
   - Encouraging participation

## Cultural Transmission

### Vertical Transmission
- Mother to offspring
- Critical learning period: 2-10 years
- Technique refinement: Lifetime
- Error correction: Active

### Horizontal Transmission
- Peer learning
- Innovation spread
- Technique modification
- Cultural drift
