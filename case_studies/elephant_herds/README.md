# Elephant Herds: Matriarchal Wisdom and Memory Networks

## Overview

Elephant herds exemplify one of nature's most sophisticated matriarchal societies, where decades of accumulated knowledge guide multi-generational family groups across vast landscapes. These gentle giants demonstrate remarkable memory, complex communication through infrasound, and deep emotional bonds that create resilient social networks capable of surviving in challenging environments.
