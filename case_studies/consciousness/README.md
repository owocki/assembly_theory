# Consciousness: The Ultimate Assembly Mystery

## Overview

Consciousness represents the most complex assembly we currently know of in the universe, with an estimated Assembly Index potentially exceeding 10 billion. It demonstrates how neural assemblies can create subjective experience, self-awareness, and the ability to contemplate their own assembly processes - making consciousness both an object of study and the mechanism by which we study assembly theory itself.
