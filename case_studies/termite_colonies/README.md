# Termite Colony Organization Case Study

## Overview

Termite colonies represent one of nature's most sophisticated examples of social organization, featuring complex caste systems, architectural marvels, and emergent collective intelligence. These eusocial insects have evolved intricate societies that can persist for decades and construct some of the most impressive biological structures on Earth.

## Assembly Index: 30-75

- **Founding pair**: AI = 30
- **Young colony (100s)**: AI = 40
- **Mature colony (1000s)**: AI = 50
