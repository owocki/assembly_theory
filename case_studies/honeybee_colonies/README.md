# Honeybee Colonies: Superorganism Architecture and Division of Labor

## Overview

Honeybee colonies represent one of nature's most sophisticated examples of eusocial organization, where tens of thousands of individuals function as a coherent superorganism. Through complex division of labor, architectural engineering, and multi-modal communication systems, honeybee colonies achieve levels of organization that rival human societies in their complexity and efficiency.

  ↓
Colony needs met
```

└── Drone cells (edges)
```

### Wax Production

**Biosynthesis Process**

## Communication Systems

### Dance Language

**Waggle Dance Encoding**
```
Distance = Duration of waggle run
Direction = Angle relative to vertical
Quality = Vigor of dance
Odor = Resource identity

Information capacity: ~10 bits/dance
```

**Dance Types**
- Round dance: <50m
- Waggle dance: >50m
- Tremble dance: Forager recruitment
- Stop signal: Danger alert

### Pheromone Communication

**Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP)**
```
Components:
├── 9-ODA (queen recognition)
├── 9-HDA (worker ovary suppression)
├── HOB (attraction)
├── HVA (clustering)
└── 10-HDAA (stability)
```

**Other Pheromones**

- Brood pheromone (larval needs)
- Footprint pheromone (surface marking)

## Thermoregulation

### Temperature Control

**Heating Mechanisms**
- Muscle contractions
- Clustering behavior
- Metabolic heat generation

### Collective Coordination

```
Temperature sensing → Response threshold
         ↓                    ↓
Individual action → Collective effect
         ↓                    ↓
Feedback loops → Homeostasis
