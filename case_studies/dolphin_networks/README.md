# Dolphin Networks: Complex Marine Social Systems

## Overview

Dolphin social networks represent one of the ocean's most sophisticated examples of non-human society, featuring multi-level alliances, cultural transmission, and complex communication systems. These marine mammals have evolved intricate social structures that rival those of great apes, demonstrating how intelligence and sociality can emerge independently in aquatic environments.
