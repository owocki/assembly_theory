- N = Population
- β = Scaling exponent (0.8-1.2)
```

#### Infrastructure Scaling
```
Sublinear scaling (β < 1):
- Physical infrastructure

- Transportation networks
- Housing stock

Superlinear scaling (β > 1):

- Information flows
```

### Network Effects

```
Network value ∝ N²
Where N = number of connected individuals

Urban applications:
- Social networks

- Cultural exchange
```
