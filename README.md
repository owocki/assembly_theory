# Assembly Theory Repository

## What is Assembly Theory?

Assembly theory is a framework developed to quantify the complexity and evolution of objects by measuring how they are assembled from basic building blocks. It provides a mathematical approach to understanding how complex structures emerge from simpler components through a series of assembly steps.

### Origins and Development

- Developed by Lee Cronin (University of Glasgow) and Sara Walker (Arizona State University)
- First major publications appeared around 2017-2021
- Combines concepts from chemistry, physics, information theory, and complexity science
- Originally developed to detect biosignatures and understand the origin of life

## Core Concepts

### 1. Assembly Index (AI)
- The minimum number of steps required to assemble an object from basic building blocks
- Higher assembly index indicates greater complexity
- Provides a quantitative measure of molecular complexity

### 2. Assembly Space
- The theoretical space containing all possible objects that can be assembled
- Includes all pathways and intermediate steps
- Grows exponentially with the number of available building blocks

### 3. Assembly Pathways
- The specific sequence of steps used to construct an object
- Multiple pathways may exist to create the same object
- Shortest pathway determines the assembly index

## Key Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Construction
- Complex objects are built from simpler sub-units
- Sub-units can be reused across different assemblies
- Creates a nested hierarchy of complexity

### 2. Path Dependency
- The history of assembly matters
- Objects carry information about their construction process
- Evolution and selection can optimize assembly pathways

### 3. Combinatorial Explosion
- The number of possible objects grows rapidly with assembly steps
- Selection mechanisms are needed to navigate vast assembly spaces
- Living systems represent highly selected regions of assembly space

## Master Assembly Index

This repository provides a comprehensive cross-reference of all assemblies, organized by assembly index (AI) value.
