# Network Analysis in Assembly Theory

## Network Assembly Foundations

Many complex assemblies exhibit network structures where components are interconnected through various relationships. This document provides mathematical frameworks for analyzing assembly networks across domains.

## Basic Network Assembly Definitions

### 1. Assembly Network Representation

```
G = (V, E, W, A)

Where:
V = {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} : set of assembly components (nodes)
E ⊆ V × V : set of assembly relationships (edges)
W : E → ℝ⁺ : edge weight function (interaction strength)
A : V → ℕ : node assembly index function
```

### 2. Network Assembly Index

Total assembly complexity of a network:

```
AI_network(G) = Σᵢ A(vᵢ) + Σₑ∈E W(e) × Connection_complexity(e)

Connection_complexity(e) = f(A(source), A(target), interaction_type)
```

### 3. Assembly Flow Networks

For networks with directional assembly processes:

```
Flow_balance: Σᵢₙ flow_in(v) = Σₒᵤₜ flow_out(v) + assembly_rate(v)

Total network throughput: Φ = Σᵥ assembly_rate(v)
```

## Network Topology Metrics

### 4. Assembly Network Density

Connectivity relative to maximum possible:

```
D(G) = 2|E| / (|V|(|V|-1))

For weighted networks:
D_weighted(G) = Σₑ∈E W(e) / (|V|(|V|-1) × W_max)
```

### 5. Assembly Clustering Coefficient

Local connectivity patterns:

```
For node v:
C(v) = 2T(v) / (k(v)(k(v)-1))

Where T(v) = triangles containing v, k(v) = degree of v

Global clustering:
C(G) = (1/|V|) Σᵥ C(v)
```

### 6. Assembly Path Metrics

#### Shortest Assembly Paths
```
d(u,v) = minimum assembly steps between nodes u and v

Average assembly path length:
L(G) = (1/(|V|(|V|-1))) ΣᵤΣᵥ≠ᵤ d(u,v)
```

#### Assembly Efficiency
```
E(G) = (1/(|V|(|V|-1))) Σᵤ Σᵥ≠ᵤ 1/d(u,v)

High efficiency: short paths between most nodes
Low efficiency: long paths, disconnected components
```

## Centrality Measures for Assembly Networks

### 7. Assembly Degree Centrality

Importance based on direct connections:

```
C_degree(v) = k(v) / (|V|-1)

For weighted networks:
C_degree_weighted(v) = Σᵤ∈N(v) W(v,u) / W_total
```

### 8. Assembly Betweenness Centrality

Importance as intermediary in assembly pathways:

```
C_betweenness(v) = Σₛ≠ᵥ≠ₜ σₛₜ(v) / σₛₜ

Where:
σₛₜ = number of shortest paths from s to t
σₛₜ(v) = number of those paths passing through v
```

### 9. Assembly Closeness Centrality

Importance based on proximity to all other assemblies:

```
C_closeness(v) = (|V|-1) / Σᵤ≠ᵥ d(v,u)

High closeness: quickly reaches all other assemblies
Low closeness: peripherally located in network
```

### 10. Assembly PageRank

Importance based on connections to important assemblies:

```
PR(v) = (1-d)/|V| + d Σᵤ∈M(v) PR(u)/L(u)

Where:
d = damping factor (typically 0.85)
M(v) = nodes linking to v
L(u) = outbound links from u
```

## Assembly Network Dynamics

### 11. Network Growth Models

#### Preferential Assembly Attachment
```
P(new_connection to v) ∝ k(v)^α × A(v)^β

Where:
α = degree preference parameter
β = assembly complexity preference parameter

Result: Scale-free networks with power-law degree distribution
```

#### Assembly Space Exploration
```
P(new_node with AI = n) ∝ exp(-n/T_exploration)

Where T_exploration represents exploration "temperature"
High T: explores high-complexity assemblies
Low T: focuses on simple assemblies
```

### 12. Assembly Cascade Dynamics

How assembly formation triggers other assemblies:

```
dA(v,t)/dt = r(v) × Π_u∈inputs(v) A(u,t) - δ(v) × A(v,t)

Where:
r(v) = assembly formation rate
δ(v) = assembly decay rate
inputs(v) = prerequisite assemblies for v
```

### 13. Network Assembly Robustness

Resilience to component failure:

```
Robustness = 1 - ΔΦ/Φ₀

Where:
Φ₀ = original network function
ΔΦ = function loss after node/edge removal

Measure robustness against:
- Random failures
- Targeted attacks on high-centrality nodes
- Correlated failures
```

## Multi-Layer Assembly Networks

### 14. Multi-Layer Network Representation

```
M = {G₁, G₂, ..., G_L, E_inter}

Where:
G_l = (V_l, E_l) = layer l network
E_inter = inter-layer connections

Examples:
- Biological: genetic, protein, metabolic layers
- Technological: hardware, software, user layers
- Social: friendship, collaboration, communication layers
```

### 15. Inter-Layer Assembly Dependencies

```
Dependency strength between layers:
D(l₁, l₂) = |E_inter(l₁, l₂)| / (|V_l₁| × |V_l₂|)

Cascade probability:
P_cascade(l₁ → l₂) = D(l₁, l₂) × Overlap(failed_nodes)
```

### 16. Multi-Layer Assembly Index

```
AI_multilayer = Σ_l AI(G_l) + Σ_{l₁,l₂} AI_coupling(l₁, l₂)

Where AI_coupling accounts for inter-layer complexity
```

## Assembly Network Motifs

### 17. Assembly Motif Detection

Frequent small subnetworks in assembly networks:

```
Motif significance:
Z_score = (N_observed - N_random) / σ_random

Common assembly motifs:
- Feed-forward loops (regulation cascades)
- Bi-fans (resource sharing)
- Cliques (tight coupling)
- Stars (hub-based organization)
```

### 18. Assembly Motif Functions

```
Feed-forward loop:
- Filters noise in assembly signals
- Creates temporal delays
- Enables coherent assembly activation

Bi-fan motif:
- Enables resource multiplexing
- Creates redundant pathways
- Balances competing assembly processes
```

## Community Structure in Assembly Networks

### 19. Assembly Community Detection

Identify groups of tightly coupled assemblies:

```
Modularity optimization:
Q = (1/2m) Σᵢⱼ (Aᵢⱼ - kᵢkⱼ/2m) δ(cᵢ, cⱼ)

Where:
Aᵢⱼ = adjacency matrix element
kᵢ = degree of node i
m = total edges
cᵢ = community of node i
δ = Kronecker delta
```

### 20. Assembly Module Functionality

```
Module assembly index:
AI_module = Σᵥ∈module A(v) + Internal_connections + Interface_complexity

Module autonomy:
Autonomy = Internal_edges / (Internal_edges + Boundary_edges)
```

## Temporal Assembly Networks

### 21. Time-Varying Assembly Networks

```
Temporal network: G(t) = (V(t), E(t), W(t))

Assembly event sequence:
Events = {(t₁, add_node, v₁), (t₂, add_edge, e₁), ...}

Temporal paths: paths that respect temporal ordering
```

### 22. Assembly Network Evolution

How network structure changes over time:

```
Structural evolution metrics:
- Density evolution: D(t)
- Clustering evolution: C(t)
- Modularity evolution: Q(t)
- Diameter evolution: d_max(t)

Evolution drivers:
- Assembly innovation rate
- Selection pressure changes
- Environmental perturbations
- Network size effects
```
