# Assembly Theory Mathematical Framework

## Core Assembly Equations

### 1. Assembly Index Definition

The Assembly Index (AI) of an object is defined as the minimum number of assembly steps required to construct that object from a set of basic building blocks.

```
AI(O) = min{n : ∃ sequence (s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ) such that sₙ = O}
```

Where:
- O is the target object
- sᵢ are assembly steps
- Each step combines previously assembled components
- Basic building blocks have AI = 1

### 2. Assembly Space Growth

The number of possible objects at assembly index n follows exponential growth:

```
N(n) = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ C(B + i - 1, i) × R^i
```

Where:
- N(n) = number of objects with AI ≤ n
- B = number of basic building blocks
- R = average reuse factor of sub-assemblies
- C(n,k) = binomial coefficient

### 3. Selection Pressure Equation

The probability of an object existing in observable quantities:

```
P(O) = (AI(O)^(-α)) × (Copy_Number(O)^β) × exp(-E(O)/kT)
```

Where:
- α = complexity penalty parameter (typically 1-3)
- β = selection amplification parameter (typically 0.5-2)
- E(O) = energy cost of assembly
- k = effective "temperature" of the system
- T = characteristic time scale

### 4. Assembly Pathway Optimization

For objects with multiple possible assembly pathways:

```
AI_optimal(O) = min{AI(P) : P ∈ Pathways(O)}
```

With pathway probability:

```
P(pathway) ∝ exp(-Σᵢ ΔGᵢ/RT)
```

Where ΔGᵢ is the free energy change for step i.

### 5. Copy Number Dynamics

Temporal evolution of copy numbers:

```
dN(O,t)/dt = k_formation × ∏ᵢ N(precursor_i) - k_decay × N(O,t)
```

For self-replicating assemblies:

```
dN(O,t)/dt = r × N(O,t) × (1 - N(O,t)/K) - δ × N(O,t)
```

Where r is replication rate, K is carrying capacity, δ is decay rate.

### 6. Information Content of Assemblies

Assembly information content:

```
I(O) = log₂(N_pathways(O)) + Σᵢ log₂(N_choices(step_i))
```

For hierarchical assemblies with reuse:

```
I_compressed(O) = H(components) + H(structure)
```

Where H is Shannon entropy.

### 7. Network Assembly Metrics

For network-based assemblies (ecosystems, social networks, etc.):

```
AI_network = AI_nodes + AI_topology + AI_dynamics
```

With network complexity:

```
C_network = -Σᵢⱼ pᵢⱼ log pᵢⱼ + γ × Clustering_coefficient
```

### 8. Cross-Domain Assembly Interactions

When assemblies from different domains interact:

```
AI_hybrid = AI₁ + AI₂ + AI_interface + Σ AI_emergent_properties
```

Interface complexity:

```
AI_interface = f(compatibility, translation_mechanisms, boundary_effects)
```

## Thermodynamic Constraints

### 9. Landauer's Principle for Assembly

Minimum energy cost for irreversible assembly operations:

```
E_min = k_B T ln(2) × N_irreversible_bits
```

### 10. Maximum Entropy Production

Assembly systems evolve toward states that maximize entropy production:

```
dS/dt = max{Σᵢ Jᵢ × (∂S/∂xᵢ)} subject to constraints
```

Where Jᵢ are assembly fluxes and xᵢ are system variables.

## Scaling Laws

### 11. Assembly Time Scaling

Time required for assembly scales with complexity:

```
T_assembly ∝ AI(O)^α × N_parallel^(-β)
```

Where α ≈ 1.2-1.8 and β ≈ 0.8-1.0 depending on parallelization efficiency.

### 12. Resource Scaling

Material and energy requirements:

```
Resources(O) = R₀ × AI(O)^γ × (1 + ε × Complexity_penalty)
```

Where γ ≈ 1.1-1.4 for most assembly types.

## Computational Complexity

### 13. Assembly Index Calculation Complexity

Finding optimal assembly index is NP-hard:

```
Complexity(AI_calculation) = O(n!) for exact solutions
Complexity(AI_approximation) = O(n² log n) for greedy algorithms
```

### 14. Assembly Space Exploration

Searching assembly space for viable objects:

```
Search_efficiency ∝ Selection_pressure × Replication_fidelity × Mutation_rate
```

## Stochastic Assembly Models

### 15. Random Assembly Process

Probability of successful assembly via random combination:

```
P_random = ∏ᵢ (N_compatible(step_i) / N_total(step_i))
```

### 16. Guided Assembly Process

With selection and memory:

```
P_guided = P_random × Selection_advantage × Memory_factor
```

## Evolutionary Assembly Dynamics

### 17. Assembly Fitness Landscape

Fitness as function of assembly structure:

```
f(O) = Functionality(O) - Cost(AI(O)) + Network_effects(O)
```

### 18. Assembly Evolution Equation

Change in assembly distribution over time:

```
∂P(O,t)/∂t = Σ_O' [W(O'→O) × P(O',t)] - λ(O) × P(O,t)
```

Where W(O'→O) is transition probability and λ(O) is removal rate.

## Measurement and Detection

### 19. Assembly Signature Detection

Signal-to-noise ratio for assembly detection:

```
SNR = (Copy_number × AI_signal) / √(Background_complexity)
```

### 20. Statistical Assembly Tests

Test for non-random assembly:

```
χ² = Σᵢ (Observed_i - Expected_random_i)² / Expected_random_i
```

## Applications to Specific Domains

### 21. Molecular Assembly

For chemical systems:

```
AI_molecular = Σ_bonds Bond_complexity + Stereochemistry_factor
```

### 22. Biological Assembly

For living systems:

```
AI_biological = Genetic_information + Epigenetic_factors + Environmental_interactions
```

### 23. Technological Assembly

For engineered systems:

```
AI_tech = Design_complexity + Manufacturing_steps + System_integration
```

### 24. Cognitive Assembly

For information processing systems:

```
AI_cognitive = Processing_steps + Memory_organization + Learning_capacity
```

## Boundary Conditions and Limits

### 25. Physical Limits

Quantum mechanical constraints:

```
AI_max ≤ N_atoms × log₂(N_quantum_states)
```

### 26. Thermodynamic Limits

Second law constraints:

```
ΔS_universe ≥ 0 for all assembly processes
```

### 27. Information-Theoretic Limits

Landauer limit for computation:

```
E_computation ≥ k_B T ln(2) × N_bit_operations
```

## Future Extensions

### 28. Quantum Assembly Theory

For quantum systems:

```
AI_quantum = Classical_AI + Quantum_coherence_factor + Entanglement_complexity
```

### 29. Relativistic Assembly

For high-energy systems:

```
AI_relativistic = Rest_frame_AI × Lorentz_factor + Spacetime_curvature_effects
```

### 30. Multi-Scale Assembly

Across scale hierarchies:

```
AI_multiscale = Σ_scales AI_scale_i × Coupling_factor_i
```
