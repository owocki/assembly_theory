# Assembly Complexity Metrics

## Fundamental Complexity Measures

### 1. Assembly Index (AI)

The primary measure of assembly complexity:

```
AI(object) = minimum assembly steps from basic building blocks

Properties:
- AI(basic_block) = 1
- AI(composite) ≥ max(AI(components))
- AI grows with structural complexity
- Accounts for reuse of sub-assemblies
```

### 2. Normalized Assembly Index (NAI)

Compare assemblies with different building block sets:

```
NAI(O) = AI(O) / log₂(|Building_Block_Set|)

Range: [0, ∞)
Interpretation: Complexity relative to available building blocks
```

### 3. Assembly Efficiency (AE)

Measure of optimal assembly pathway usage:

```
AE(O) = AI_optimal(O) / AI_actual(O)

Range: (0, 1]
AE = 1: Optimal assembly pathway used
AE < 1: Sub-optimal assembly pathway
```

## Information-Theoretic Measures

### 4. Assembly Information Content (AIC)

Bits required to specify assembly instructions:

```
AIC(O) = Σᵢ log₂(choices_at_step_i)

For molecular assemblies:
AIC_molecular = Σ_bonds log₂(possible_bond_types) + stereochemistry_bits

For network assemblies:
AIC_network = Σ_edges log₂(possible_connections)
```

### 5. Compressed Assembly Information (CAI)

Account for pattern reuse and regularity:

```
CAI(O) = AIC(O) - Redundancy(O)

Redundancy(O) = Σ_patterns Frequency(pattern) × log₂(Frequency(pattern))
```

### 6. Kolmogorov Assembly Complexity (KAC)

Shortest program to generate assembly instructions:

```
KAC(O) = min{|p| : U(p) = Assembly_Instructions(O)}

Where U is universal Turing machine
Note: KAC is uncomputable, but approximable
```

## Structural Complexity Measures

### 7. Hierarchical Depth (HD)

Maximum nesting levels in assembly structure:

```
HD(O) = max_path(depth from basic blocks to final object)

For molecules: bond connectivity depth
For organisms: tissue → organ → system hierarchy
For technology: component → module → system levels
```

### 8. Assembly Tree Width (ATW)

Maximum branching factor in assembly tree:

```
ATW(O) = max_node(number of child components)

Indicates parallelizability of assembly process
High ATW: highly parallel assembly
Low ATW: sequential assembly process
```

### 9. Structural Entropy (SE)

Uniformity of component organization:

```
SE(O) = -Σᵢ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ)

Where pᵢ = frequency of component type i
High SE: diverse, heterogeneous structure
Low SE: uniform, repetitive structure
```

## Dynamic Complexity Measures

### 10. Assembly Time Complexity (ATC)

Temporal resources required for assembly:

```
ATC(O) = Expected_assembly_time / Minimum_possible_time

Factors:
- Sequential dependencies
- Resource availability
- Error correction time
- Environmental constraints
```

### 11. Assembly Energy Complexity (AEC)

Energetic cost of assembly process:

```
AEC(O) = Total_energy_cost / Theoretical_minimum_energy

Includes:
- Bond formation/breaking energy
- Transport and positioning costs
- Error correction energy
- Waste heat generation
```

### 12. Assembly Stability (AS)

Resistance to disassembly:

```
AS(O) = Σᵢ Binding_energyᵢ / (k_B T × AI(O))

High AS: stable against thermal fluctuations
Low AS: easily disassembled structures
```

## Network Complexity Measures

### 13. Assembly Network Density (AND)

Connectivity in assembly interaction networks:

```
AND = 2E / (N(N-1))

Where E = edges, N = nodes
Range: [0, 1]
AND = 1: fully connected network
AND → 0: sparse network
```

### 14. Assembly Clustering Coefficient (ACC)

Local connectivity patterns:

```
ACC = (3 × number_of_triangles) / number_of_connected_triples

Measures tendency for assembly components to cluster
High ACC: modular assembly structure
Low ACC: random assembly connections
```

### 15. Assembly Path Length (APL)

Typical separation in assembly networks:

```
APL = average shortest path between all node pairs

Small APL: efficient assembly communication
Large APL: isolated assembly components
```

## Functional Complexity Measures

### 16. Assembly Functionality Index (AFI)

Complexity of functions performed:

```
AFI(O) = Σ_functions Complexity(functionᵢ) × Weightᵢ

For biological systems:
AFI_bio = Metabolic_functions + Regulatory_functions + Structural_functions

For technological systems:
AFI_tech = Processing_functions + Control_functions + Interface_functions
```

### 17. Assembly Versatility (AV)

Range of different functions possible:

```
AV(O) = Number_of_distinct_functions / Total_possible_functions

High AV: multi-functional assembly
Low AV: specialized assembly
```

### 18. Assembly Adaptability (AA)

Capacity to modify function based on context:

```
AA(O) = Σ_contexts P(context) × Functional_change(context)

Measures phenotypic/behavioral plasticity
High AA: highly adaptive systems
Low AA: rigid, inflexible systems
```

## Evolutionary Complexity Measures

### 19. Assembly Evolvability (AEv)

Capacity for evolutionary change:

```
AEv(O) = Mutation_rate × Selection_response × Heritability

For biological systems: genetic variation capacity
For technological systems: design iteration capability
For cultural systems: innovation and adoption rates
```

### 20. Assembly Fitness Landscape Ruggedness (AFLR)

Complexity of optimization landscape:

```
AFLR = σ(fitness_differences) / mean(fitness)

High AFLR: many local optima, difficult optimization
Low AFLR: smooth fitness landscape, easy optimization
```

### 21. Assembly Innovation Rate (AIR)

Frequency of novel assembly patterns:

```
AIR = Novel_assemblies_per_time / Total_assemblies_per_time

Measures creative capacity of assembly systems
High AIR: rapidly innovating systems
Low AIR: conservative, stable systems
```
