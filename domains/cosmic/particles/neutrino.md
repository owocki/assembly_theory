# Neutrino

## Assembly Properties
- **Assembly Index**: 1
- **Domain**: Cosmic
- **Origin Time**: 1 second after Big Bang
- **Copy Number**: ~10^86 in observable universe

## Description

Neutrinos are fundamental particles that represent one of the earliest assemblies in the cosmic domain. With an assembly index of 1, they are among the most basic building blocks of reality, formed during the first second after the Big Bang.

## Assembly Process

Neutrinos emerge directly from fundamental physics processes:
- **Primary Assembly**: Generated through weak nuclear force interactions
- **Building Blocks**: Pure quantum field excitations
- **Assembly Steps**: Single step from quantum vacuum

## Physical Properties

- **Mass**: Nearly massless (~0.1 eV/c²)
- **Charge**: Neutral
- **Spin**: 1/2 (fermion)
- **Interaction**: Only via weak nuclear force and gravity

## Assembly Context

### Predecessors
- Quantum vacuum fluctuations
- Fundamental forces

### Descendants
- Contributes to nucleosynthesis processes
- Essential for stellar fusion cycles
- Component in more complex cosmic assemblies

### Relationships
- **Related Assemblies**: Electron (AI: 1), Muon (AI: 1)
- **Assembly Pathway**: Fundamental particle → complex atoms → molecules

## Significance in Assembly Theory

Neutrinos demonstrate the principle that even the simplest assemblies carry profound information about cosmic history. Despite their minimal interaction with matter, they preserve information about the universe's first moments and continue to influence cosmic evolution through their vast numbers and subtle gravitational effects.

## Modern Detection

The challenge of detecting neutrinos has led to sophisticated technological assemblies (detectors with AI > 10^9), showing how simple assemblies can drive the creation of highly complex observational systems.
