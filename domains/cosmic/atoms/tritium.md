# Tritium

## Assembly Properties
- **Assembly Index**: 4
- **Domain**: Cosmic
- **Origin Time**: 20 minutes after Big Bang (trace amounts)
- **Copy Number**: Extremely rare (~1 in 10¹⁸ hydrogen atoms)

## Description

Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen with assembly index 4, consisting of one proton and two neutrons. It represents the most complex hydrogen isotope and demonstrates nuclear instability in simple assemblies.

## Assembly Process

Tritium forms through neutron capture:
- **Building Blocks**: Deuterium (AI: 3) + Neutron (AI: 3)
- **Assembly Steps**:
  1. Neutron absorption by deuterium
  2. Nuclear binding via strong force
  3. Unstable configuration (beta decay)

## Physical Properties

- **Mass**: 3.016 atomic mass units
- **Half-life**: 12.32 years
- **Decay Mode**: Beta decay (T → ³He + e⁻ + νₜ)
- **Nuclear Binding Energy**: 8.48 MeV

## Assembly Context

### Predecessors
- Deuterium nuclei
- Free neutrons from nuclear processes
- Cosmic ray interactions

### Descendants
- **Helium-3**: Primary decay product
- **Fusion Reactions**: D-T fusion in stars/reactors
- **Radioactive Decay Chain**: Part of cosmic ray spallation

### Relationships
- **Related Assemblies**: Deuterium (AI: 3), Helium-3 (AI: 4), Helium-4 (AI: 4)
- **Isotope Family**: Heaviest hydrogen isotope

## Significance in Assembly Theory

Tritium illustrates how increased assembly complexity doesn't guarantee stability. Despite having higher AI than deuterium, tritium is unstable, showing that assembly pathways can lead to metastable configurations that eventually decay to more stable forms.

## Formation Mechanisms

### Cosmic Sources
- **Cosmic Ray Spallation**: High-energy particles hitting atmosphere
- **Solar Wind**: Minor production in solar atmosphere
- **Stellar Nucleosynthesis**: Trace amounts in stellar cores

### Terrestrial Sources
- **Nuclear Reactors**: Neutron absorption by deuterium
- **Nuclear Weapons**: Fusion fuel production
- **Atmospheric**: Cosmic ray interactions with nitrogen

## Nuclear Applications

### Fusion Energy
- **D-T Reaction**: Most efficient fusion reaction (D + T → ⁴He + n + 17.6 MeV)
- **ITER Project**: Primary fuel for experimental reactors
- **Fusion Weapons**: Thermonuclear device fuel

### Scientific Applications
- **Radioactive Tracer**: Environmental and biological studies
- **Self-Luminous Paint**: Radioluminescent materials
- **Neutron Sources**: T + D reactions

## Safety Considerations

Tritium's beta radiation is relatively weak but poses biological risks through incorporation into water and organic molecules, demonstrating how simple assemblies can have complex interactions with biological systems.
