# Salt (NaCl)

## Assembly Index: 18

## Domain: Geological

## Time Origin: 4.4 billion years ago

## Description

Salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) represents one of the earliest and most fundamental mineral assemblies on Earth. Its formation demonstrates how simple ionic interactions can create stable, crystalline structures that persist across geological timescales.

## Assembly Pathway

### Building Blocks
- Sodium atom (Na): AI = 11
- Chlorine atom (Cl): AI = 17

### Assembly Steps
1. **Sodium ionization**: Na → Na⁺ + e⁻ (energy input from cosmic processes)
2. **Chlorine electron capture**: Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻
3. **Ionic bonding**: Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → NaCl (electrostatic attraction)
4. **Crystal lattice formation**: Multiple NaCl units arrange in cubic structure
5. **Precipitation from solution**: Dissolved ions crystallize under appropriate conditions

### Total Assembly Steps: 18
- Atomic assembly: 28 steps (11 + 17)
- Molecular formation: 3 steps
- Crystal organization: 12 steps

## Physical Properties

- **Crystal structure**: Face-centered cubic (halite structure)
