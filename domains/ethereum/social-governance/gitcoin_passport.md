## Significance in Assembly Theory

Gitcoin Passport exemplifies modular assembly in identity systems. Rather than creating a monolithic identity solution, it assembles various "identity atoms" (stamps) into a flexible, composable system. Each stamp has relatively low complexity (AI: 1,000-5,000), but their combination creates a robust identity verification system.

The assembly index of 85,000 reflects the sophisticated orchestration required to:
- Integrate diverse identity sources
- Calculate meaningful trust scores
- Preserve privacy while proving personhood
- Enable seamless application integration

This modular approach allows the system to evolve by adding new stamps rather than rebuilding core infrastructure, demonstrating optimal assembly patterns for identity systems.

## Identity Assembly Formula

The Passport score can be expressed as:
```
PassportScore = Σ(StampWeight × StampValue × DecayFactor) + NetworkEffects
```

Where:
- StampWeight varies by verification difficulty
- StampValue is binary (verified/not verified)
- DecayFactor reduces value over time
- NetworkEffects increase with adoption
