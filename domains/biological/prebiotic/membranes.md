## Assembly Network Position
Lipid bilayer membranes occupy a pivotal position in the biological assembly network as the structures that enabled the transition from chemical systems to living cells. They represent one of the first examples of complex self-assembly, where simple amphiphilic molecules spontaneously organize into sophisticated functional architectures. Membranes created the possibility for compartmentalization, allowing the evolution of specialized chemical environments and the maintenance of organization against entropy. Their formation represents a crucial step in the origin of life, providing the boundary conditions necessary for more complex biological assemblies like proteins, nucleic acids, and ultimately complete cellular systems. The emergence of membrane-bounded compartments marked the beginning of true cellular organization and the ability to maintain complex chemical gradients and reaction networks that define living systems.
