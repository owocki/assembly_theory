## Assembly Network Position
Short peptides occupy a critical position in the biological assembly network as the first functional protein-like molecules that emerge from amino acid assemblies. They represent the transition from individual molecular building blocks to cooperative molecular systems capable of catalysis, recognition, and information storage. Peptides demonstrate how the assembly of amino acids through peptide bonds creates emergent properties - catalytic activity, structural organization, and molecular recognition - that are not present in individual amino acids. This makes them essential intermediates in the pathway from prebiotic chemistry to complex protein assemblies, serving as both evolutionary stepping stones and functional molecules in their own right. Their ability to fold, bind substrates, and catalyze reactions makes them crucial for understanding how complex biological functions emerge from simpler molecular assemblies.
