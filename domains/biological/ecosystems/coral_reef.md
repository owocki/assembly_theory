- Live in coral tissues
- Provide 90% of coral's energy
- Receive nutrients and protection

Exchange:
Coral → Algae: CO₂, nutrients, protection
Algae → Coral: Glucose, amino acids, lipids

Benefits:
- Enhanced calcification
- Increased growth rates
- Survival in nutrient-poor waters
```

## Ecosystem Structure

## Reproduction and Recruitment

### Coral Reproduction

#### Sexual Reproduction
```
Mass spawning events:
- Synchronized release
- Triggered by lunar cycles
- Temperature and day length cues
- Species-specific timing

Larval development:
- Planula larvae
- Free-swimming phase: Days to months
- Settlement on hard substrate
- Metamorphosis to polyp
```

#### Asexual Reproduction
```
Fragmentation:
- Storm damage creates fragments
- Each can regrow into colony
- Important for local spread

Budding:
- New polyps from existing ones
- Colony growth mechanism
- Maintains genetic uniformity
```

### Recruitment Dynamics
```
Settlement requirements:
- Hard substrate
- Appropriate microbial communities
- Low algae cover
- Chemical cues from adults

Success factors:
- Larval supply
- Habitat availability
- Post-settlement survival
- Growth to reproductive size
```

## Threats and Disturbances

### Climate Change Impacts

#### Coral Bleaching
```
Temperature stress response:
- 1-2°C above normal triggers bleaching
- Zooxanthellae expelled from tissues
- Coral appears white
- Can recover if stress brief

Mechanism:
1. Heat stress disrupts photosynthesis
2. Reactive oxygen species produced
3. Coral expels algae to avoid damage
4. Without algae, coral starves
5. Death if bleaching prolonged
```

#### Ocean Acidification
```
pH reduction effects:
- Decreased calcification rates
- Weaker skeletal structures
- Increased dissolution
- Competitive disadvantage

Mechanism:
CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃ → H⁺ + HCO₃⁻
Lower pH reduces carbonate availability:
Ca²⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → CaCO₃
```

### Local Stressors

#### Pollution
```
Nutrient pollution:
- Increased algae growth
- Coral-algae competition
- Reduced water quality
- Eutrophication effects

Sedimentation:
- Smothers coral polyps
- Reduces light penetration
- Requires energy for removal
- Prevents larval settlement
```

#### Overfishing
```
Ecosystem impacts:
- Reduced herbivore populations
- Algae overgrowth
- Trophic cascade effects
- Loss of cleaning services

Targeted species:
- Large predators (sharks, groupers)
- Herbivorous fish (parrotfish)
- Invertebrates (sea cucumbers)
```

#### Physical Damage
