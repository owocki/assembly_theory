## Assembly Network Position
Bacterial cells represent the most fundamental living assemblies, marking the transition from chemical to biological complexity. They demonstrate how molecular assemblies can achieve self-organization, self-maintenance, and self-reproduction - the hallmarks of life. Bacteria serve as the foundation for all subsequent biological assemblies, from complex cells to multicellular organisms to ecosystems. Their emergence represents one of the most significant assembly events in the universe, creating systems capable of evolving, adapting, and generating increasingly complex assemblies through billions of years of biological evolution.
