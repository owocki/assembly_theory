## Description

Basic viruses represent minimal biological assemblies that exist at the boundary between living and non-living systems. These obligate intracellular parasites demonstrate how genetic information can be packaged with minimal structural components to achieve replication, representing one of the simplest forms of organized biological information storage and transfer.

## Assembly Pathway

### Building Blocks
- Nucleic acids (DNA or RNA): AI = 1000-2000
- Capsid proteins: AI = 300-500 each

- Lipid envelope: AI = 500 (if present)

### Assembly Steps
1. **Genome replication**: Synthesis of viral nucleic acids
2. **Protein expression**: Translation of viral proteins in host cell
3. **Capsid assembly**: Self-assembly of protein shell around genome
4. **Genome packaging**: Insertion of nucleic acids into capsid
5. **Envelope acquisition**: (For enveloped viruses) Membrane wrapping
6. **Maturation**: Final structural modifications and activation
7. **Release**: Exit from host cell by lysis or budding

### Total Assembly Steps: 3,000

## Formation and Replication

### Viral Life Cycle
- **Attachment**: Binding to specific host cell receptors
- **Entry**: Penetration into host cell

## Assembly Network Position
Basic viruses occupy a unique position in the biological assembly network as minimal biological entities that blur the boundary between living and non-living systems. They represent highly streamlined assemblies that contain only the essential components needed for replication: genetic information and a protective protein shell. Viruses demonstrate how biological information can be packaged with remarkable efficiency, achieving complex functions (host recognition, genome replication, offspring production) with minimal structural complexity. Their obligate dependence on cellular hosts places them at the intersection between autonomous biological assemblies (cells) and molecular assemblies, serving as bridges that facilitate horizontal gene transfer and drive evolutionary innovation. As parasitic assemblies, viruses have profoundly influenced the evolution of all cellular life forms, driving the development of immune systems, genetic diversity, and complex regulatory networks that characterize more advanced biological assemblies.
