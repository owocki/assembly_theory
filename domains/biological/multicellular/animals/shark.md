## Key Features and Adaptations

### Electroreception
- Detect electrical fields as weak as 5 billionths of a volt
- Ampullae of Lorenzini organs
- Locate hidden prey
- Navigate using Earth's magnetic field
- Most sensitive biological electrical sensors

### Dermal Denticles
- Skin covered in tooth-like scales
- Reduce drag by 8-12%
- Create vortices that pull shark forward
- Protect from parasites
- Inspired human technology (swimsuits, aircraft)

### Dental Conveyor Belt
- Produce 30,000+ teeth in lifetime
- New teeth every 1-2 weeks
- Multiple rows ready to deploy
- Species-specific tooth shapes
- Never without functional teeth

## Ecological Role

### Apex Predator Functions
- Control fish populations
- Remove sick/weak individuals
- Maintain species diversity
- Prevent overgrazing of seagrass
- Create landscape of fear

### Mesopredator
- Many species are mid-level predators
- Link between trophic levels
- Important prey for larger sharks
- Nutrient cycling

### Ecosystem Engineer
- Tiger sharks maintain seagrass beds
- Whale sharks transport nutrients
- Carcasses feed deep-sea communities

## Human Interactions

### Cultural Perspectives
- Fear and fascination
- Mythology and folklore
- Modern media representation
- Ecotourism value ($314 million annually)

### Threats from Humans
- 100 million sharks killed annually
- Finning for shark fin soup
- Bycatch in fishing gear
- Habitat destruction
- Climate change impacts

### Conservation Efforts
- CITES listings for vulnerable species
- Shark sanctuaries (3 million km²)
- Fishing regulations
- Public awareness campaigns
- Research and monitoring

## Sensory Supremacy

### Olfaction
- Detect blood at 1 part per 10 billion
- 2/3 of brain devoted to smell
- Directional smelling
- Chemical trail following

### Vision
- See in extremely low light
- Tapetum lucidum for night vision
- Some species see color
- UV vision capabilities

### Lateral Line
- Detect water movement
- Sense struggling prey
- Navigate in murky water
- Social communication

### Hearing
- Detect low frequencies (10-800 Hz)
- Hear prey from 250m away
- Directional hearing
- Important for hunting

## Diversity of Forms

### Great White Shark
- Size: Up to 6 meters
- Warm-blooded adaptations
- Breaching behavior
- Coastal and pelagic

### Whale Shark
- Largest fish (up to 12 meters)
- Filter feeder
- Highly migratory
- Aggregation behavior

### Hammerhead Shark
- Cephalofoil provides:
  - Enhanced electroreception
  - Better vision coverage
  - Improved maneuverability
- Social schooling

### Deep Sea Sharks
- Bioluminescence (some species)
- Extreme pressure adaptations
- Slow metabolism
- Long lifespans (400+ years for Greenland shark)

## Reproductive Strategies

### Oviparity (Egg-laying)
- 40% of species
- Mermaid's purse cases
- Extended development
- No parental care

### Viviparity (Live birth)
- Placental connection (some)
- Intrauterine cannibalism (some)
- Few, well-developed pups
- Long gestation (up to 2 years)

### Ovoviviparity
- Eggs hatch internally
- Nourished by yolk
- Born fully formed
- Most common strategy

## Physiological Marvels

### Osmoregulation
- Retain urea in blood
- Match seawater osmolarity
- Specialized rectal gland
- Freshwater adaptation (Bull shark)

### Thermoregulation
- Some species partially warm-blooded
- Counter-current heat exchange
- Maintain muscle temperature
- Enhanced performance

### Immune System
- Antibodies different from other vertebrates
- Remarkable healing ability
- Cancer resistance being studied
- Antibacterial properties

## Conservation Status

### Threatened Species
- 1/3 of species threatened
- 17 species Critically Endangered
- Population declines of 70-90%
- Slow recovery due to late maturity

### Success Stories
- White shark recovery (some regions)
- Nurse shark populations stable
- Protected areas showing results
- Public perception improving
