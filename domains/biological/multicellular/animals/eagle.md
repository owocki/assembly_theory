## Key Features and Adaptations

### Vision System
- Visual acuity 4-8 times better than humans
- Can see UV spectrum
- Two foveas per eye for maximum resolution
- Nictitating membrane protects during dives
- Can spot prey from 3 km away

### Flight Mastery
- Soaring on thermals with minimal energy
- Dive speeds up to 320 km/h (Golden Eagle)
- Wing loading optimized for their hunting style
- Primary feathers act as individual airfoils
- Can fly at altitudes over 6,000 meters

### Hunting Adaptations
- Grip strength up to 400 PSI
- Talons grow continuously like fingernails
- Reversible outer toe for better grip
- Beak designed for tearing, not killing
- Crop storage for irregular feeding

## Ecological Role

### Apex Predator
- Controls populations of medium-sized animals
- Removes sick and weak individuals
- Shapes prey behavior and distribution
- Indicates ecosystem health

### Ecosystem Services
- Scavenging (some species)
- Seed dispersal (limited)
- Tourism and cultural value
- Biological pest control

## Human Interactions
