   - Voting power increases with lock duration (up to 4 years)
   - Vote on gauge weights determining reward distribution

3. Protocol Optimization
   - Protocols like Convex aggregate veCRV voting power
   - Offer higher yields than direct Curve participation
   - Create secondary markets for Curve governance

4. Economic Warfare
   - Protocols bid for gauge weight votes ("bribes")
