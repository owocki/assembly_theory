# Stone Tools

## Overview

Stone tools represent humanity's first systematic technological assemblies, demonstrating how intentional modification of natural materials could extend biological capabilities and launch the trajectory toward technological civilization.

## Basic Information

- **Category**: Tools
- **Domain**: Technological
- **Estimated Assembly Index**: ~10-100
- **First Appearance**: 3.3 million years ago

## Description

Stone tools encompass the earliest systematic technology developed by human ancestors, involving the deliberate modification of stone materials to create cutting, scraping, and piercing implements. This foundational technology enabled the expansion of human capabilities and formed the basis for all subsequent technological development.

## Key Concepts
