## Assembly Theory Implications

The spinning jenny demonstrates:
- **Multiplicative innovation**: Single process parallelized
- **Transitional technology**: Bridge between craft and industry
- **Accessibility threshold**: Complex enough for efficiency, simple enough for cottage use
- **Social catalyst**: Technology driving fundamental societal change

The assembly index progression from 8-spindle (~180) to 120-spindle (~250) jennies shows how modular expansion can increase productivity within a basic design framework. The jenny's relatively moderate complexity made it accessible to cottage workers while providing enough productivity gain to transform textile production, exemplifying how intermediate technologies can drive revolutionary change.
