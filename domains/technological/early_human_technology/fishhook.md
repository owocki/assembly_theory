# Fishhook

## Basic Information
- **Common Names**: Fish hook, gorge, angle
- **Assembly Index**: 25-60 (depending on complexity)
- **Time Period**: ~23,000 BCE - present
- **Primary Function**: Passive fishing implement for catching aquatic prey

## Assembly Components

### Basic Hook Elements
1. **Hook Body** (Index: 15-25)
   - Bone (deer, bird, fish)
   - Shell (abalone, mussel)
   - Wood (hardwood thorns)
   - Stone (slate, shale)
   - Metal (copper, bronze, iron)

2. **Point and Barb** (Index: 5-10)
   - Sharpened tip
   - Reverse barb (when present)
   - Micro-serrations

3. **Line Attachment** (Index: 5-10)
   - Eye or groove
   - Knob end
   - Flattened shank

### Composite Assemblies
- **Simple gorge**: straight double-pointed = Index ~25
- **Curved hook**: shaped bone/shell = Index ~35
- **Barbed hook**: hook + barb = Index ~45
- **Composite hook**: multiple materials + lashing = Index ~60

## Manufacturing Process

### Material Selection
1. **Bone Hooks**
   - Dense cortical bone preferred
   - Bird bones for small hooks
   - Mammal bones for larger hooks

2. **Shell Hooks**
   - Natural curve exploitation
   - Mother-of-pearl varieties
   - Thickness requirements

### Production Steps
1. **Raw Material Preparation**
   - Cutting/breaking to size
   - Initial shaping
   - Soaking (for bone)

2. **Shaping Process**
   - Grinding on abrasive stones
   - Drilling (for eyes)
   - Notching (for barbs)

3. **Finishing**
   - Fine polishing
   - Point sharpening
   - Line groove creation
