### Blade Arrangements
- **Single piece**: One curved blade
- **Composite**: Multiple microliths in series
- **Serrated**: Natural or created teeth
- **Smooth**: Polished cutting edge

### Complete Assemblies
- **Simple sickle**: wooden handle + stone blade = Index ~35
- **Composite sickle**: handle + multiple microliths + adhesive = Index ~55
- **Metal sickle**: handle + forged blade + rivets = Index ~65
- **Modern sickle**: ergonomic handle + steel blade + cushioned grip = Index ~75

## Manufacturing Process

## Assembly Theory Implications

The sickle demonstrates:
- **Composite technology**: Multiple materials optimally combined
- **Use-wear feedback**: Design improvements from user experience
- **Cultural transmission**: Knowledge preservation across generations
- **Technological lock-in**: Basic design stability over millennia

The assembly index progression from simple stone sickles (~35) to modern steel versions (~75) shows relatively modest increase compared to other tools, suggesting early optimization of the basic design principle. This reflects how some technologies reach functional optima that persist despite material improvements.
