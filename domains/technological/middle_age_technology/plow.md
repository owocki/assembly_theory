# Plow

## Basic Information
- **Common Names**: Plough, ard, scratch plow, moldboard plow
- **Assembly Index**: 45-180 (from simple ard to complex steel plows)
- **Time Period**: ~4,000 BCE - present
- **Primary Function**: Soil preparation for agriculture through turning and breaking

## Assembly Components

### Simple Ard Components

   - Long wooden shaft
   - Connection to draft power
   - Handle integration

2. **Share/Point** (Index: 15-25)
   - Pointed digging element
   - Wood, stone, or metal
   - Soil penetration design

3. **Handle/Stilt** (Index: 5-10)
   - Operator control
   - Depth regulation
   - Directional guidance

### Advanced Plow Components
1. **Moldboard** (Index: 25-40)
   - Curved surface
   - Soil turning mechanism
   - Material: wood to steel

2. **Coulter** (Index: 20-30)
   - Vertical cutting blade
   - Sod slicing
   - Path preparation

3. **Landside** (Index: 15-20)
   - Lateral stability
   - Furrow wall support
   - Wear resistance

4. **Frame Assembly** (Index: 30-50)
   - Component integration
   - Stress distribution
   - Adjustability features

### Complete Systems
- **Simple ard**: beam + share = Index ~45

- **Medieval plow**: frame + coulter + moldboard + wheels = Index ~120
- **Modern steel plow**: all components + adjustability = Index ~180

## Manufacturing Process

### Traditional Construction
1. **Wood Selection**
   - Hardwood for shares (oak)
   - Flexible wood for beams (ash)
   - Natural curves utilization

2. **Metal Components**
   - Forging iron shares
   - Hardening cutting edges
   - Attachment mechanisms

3. **Assembly Methods**
   - Mortise and tenon joints
   - Iron strapping
   - Wedge fastening

## Assembly Theory Implications

The plow demonstrates:
- **Technological accumulation**: Incremental improvements over millennia
- **System complexity**: Integration of multiple functional components
- **Cultural adaptation**: Regional variations based on local conditions
- **Social transformation**: Technology driving societal change

The assembly index progression from simple ards (~45) to modern plows (~180) represents one of humanity's most transformative technologies, fundamentally altering human relationships with land, food production, and social organization.
