# Semantic Memory

## Assembly Properties
- **Assembly Index**: 75
- **Domain**: Cognitive
- **Origin Time**: 100 million years ago
- **Copy Number**: Present in many vertebrates

## Description

Semantic memory is a cognitive assembly with index 75, representing general knowledge about the world independent of personal experience. It forms the factual knowledge base for cognition.

## Assembly Process

- **Building Blocks**: Concepts + categories + associations + facts
- **Formation**: Abstraction from episodic experiences
- **Organization**: Hierarchical and associative networks
- **Access**: Spreading activation mechanisms

## Structure

### Hierarchical Organization
- **Superordinate**: Animal, furniture, vehicle
- **Basic Level**: Dog, chair, car
- **Subordinate**: Golden retriever, rocking chair, sedan

### Network Models
- **Spreading Activation**: Activation flows through links
- **Feature Models**: Concepts as feature bundles
- **Prototype Models**: Central tendencies and typicality

## Functions

- **Categorization**: Grouping objects and events
- **Inference**: Drawing logical conclusions
- **Language**: Word meaning and comprehension
- **Problem Solving**: Domain knowledge application

## Development

- **Early Childhood**: Basic category formation
- **School Age**: Systematic knowledge acquisition
- **Adulthood**: Continued refinement and specialization
- **Aging**: Generally preserved with some decline

## Applications

- **Education**: Knowledge organization and teaching
- **AI**: Knowledge representation systems
- **Diagnosis**: Semantic memory assessment
- **Interface Design**: Intuitive categorization
