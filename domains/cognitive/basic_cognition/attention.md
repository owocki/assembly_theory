# Attention

## Assembly Properties
- **Assembly Index**: 25
- **Domain**: Cognitive
- **Origin Time**: 600 million years ago
- **Copy Number**: Universal in complex nervous systems

## Description

Attention is a cognitive assembly with index 25, representing the selective focus of consciousness on specific stimuli while filtering out irrelevant information. It forms the foundation for higher-order cognitive processes.

## Assembly Process

- **Building Blocks**: Sensory input + neural filtering + consciousness
- **Assembly Steps**:
  1. Sensory information gathering
  2. Relevance assessment and filtering
  3. Focus allocation and maintenance
  4. Background suppression mechanisms

## Components

### Attention Networks
- **Alerting Network**: Maintaining vigilant state
- **Orienting Network**: Directing attention to locations
- **Executive Network**: Resolving conflict and control

### Types of Attention
- **Selective Attention**: Focusing on specific stimuli
- **Sustained Attention**: Maintaining focus over time
- **Divided Attention**: Managing multiple tasks
- **Alternating Attention**: Switching between tasks

## Neural Mechanisms

- **Prefrontal Cortex**: Executive control
- **Parietal Cortex**: Spatial attention
- **Anterior Cingulate**: Conflict monitoring
- **Reticular Formation**: Arousal and alertness

## Evolutionary Development

### Primitive Forms
- **Orienting Responses**: Basic directional attention
- **Startle Responses**: Rapid attention shifts
- **Prey Detection**: Survival-focused attention

### Advanced Forms
- **Meta-attention**: Awareness of attention itself
- **Voluntary Control**: Deliberate attention direction
- **Abstract Focus**: Attention to concepts and ideas

## Applications

### Educational
- **Learning Enhancement**: Focused study techniques
- **Classroom Management**: Attention training
- **Cognitive Training**: Attention improvement programs

### Clinical
- **ADHD Treatment**: Attention deficit interventions
- **Meditation**: Attention cultivation practices
- **Cognitive Therapy**: Attention retraining

### Technology
- **User Interface Design**: Attention-aware systems
- **Advertising**: Attention capture strategies
- **AI Systems**: Attention mechanisms in neural networks

## Dysfunction

- **Attention Deficit**: Difficulty maintaining focus
- **Hypervigilance**: Excessive attention to threats
- **Neglect Syndrome**: Spatial attention deficits
- **Distractibility**: Difficulty filtering irrelevant stimuli

## Measurement

- **Reaction Time Tasks**: Attention switching speed
- **Continuous Performance**: Sustained attention
- **Flanker Tasks**: Selective attention ability
- **EEG/fMRI**: Neural attention markers
