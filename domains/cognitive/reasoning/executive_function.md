# Executive Function

## Assembly Properties
- **Assembly Index**: 95
- **Domain**: Cognitive
- **Origin Time**: 50 million years ago
- **Copy Number**: Highly developed in primates

## Description

Executive function is a cognitive assembly with index 95, representing high-level cognitive control processes that manage and coordinate other cognitive abilities for goal-directed behavior.

## Assembly Process

- **Building Blocks**: Inhibition + working memory + cognitive flexibility
- **Integration**: Prefrontal cortex coordination
- **Development**: Protracted maturation through adolescence
- **Control**: Top-down regulation of cognition

## Core Components

### Inhibitory Control
- **Response Inhibition**: Suppressing inappropriate responses
- **Interference Control**: Filtering irrelevant information
- **Cognitive Inhibition**: Suppressing irrelevant thoughts

### Working Memory
- **Updating**: Refreshing information in mind
- **Monitoring**: Tracking mental contents
- **Manipulation**: Mental operations on information

### Cognitive Flexibility
- **Task Switching**: Alternating between mental sets
- **Mental Set Shifting**: Changing perspectives
- **Creative Thinking**: Novel solution generation

## Higher-Order Functions

### Planning
- **Goal Setting**: Identifying desired outcomes
- **Strategy Selection**: Choosing appropriate methods
- **Sequence Organization**: Ordering steps
- **Resource Allocation**: Managing cognitive resources

### Problem Solving
- **Problem Definition**: Understanding constraints
- **Solution Generation**: Creating alternatives
- **Evaluation**: Assessing solution quality
- **Implementation**: Executing chosen solutions

### Decision Making
- **Option Generation**: Identifying choices
- **Consequence Prediction**: Anticipating outcomes
- **Value Assessment**: Weighing costs and benefits
- **Choice Selection**: Making final decisions

## Neural Mechanisms

### Brain Networks
- **Prefrontal Cortex**: Primary executive control
- **Anterior Cingulate**: Conflict monitoring
- **Parietal Cortex**: Attention control
- **Basal Ganglia**: Action selection

### Neurotransmitters
- **Dopamine**: Working memory and motivation
- **Norepinephrine**: Attention and arousal
- **Acetylcholine**: Attention and learning

## Development

### Childhood
- **Ages 3-7**: Basic inhibitory control
- **Ages 7-12**: Working memory expansion
- **Adolescence**: Cognitive flexibility maturation

### Individual Differences
- **Genetic Factors**: Heritability ~60%
- **Environmental Influences**: Stress, education, culture
- **Training Effects**: Modest but meaningful improvements

## Applications

### Education
- **Curriculum Design**: Executive function integration
- **Learning Strategies**: Metacognitive training
- **Special Education**: Executive function support

### Clinical
- **ADHD**: Executive function deficits
- **Autism**: Planning and flexibility challenges
- **Schizophrenia**: Working memory and inhibition problems
- **Dementia**: Progressive executive decline

### Occupational
- **Leadership**: Strategic thinking and decision making
- **Air Traffic Control**: Complex cognitive coordination
- **Surgery**: Precision and flexibility under pressure

## Assessment

### Neuropsychological Tests
- **Wisconsin Card Sort**: Cognitive flexibility
- **Stroop Task**: Inhibitory control
- **Tower Tasks**: Planning ability
- **Go/No-Go**: Response inhibition

### Behavioral Measures
- **Rating Scales**: Daily life executive function
- **Performance Tasks**: Laboratory assessment
- **Ecological Validity**: Real-world relevance

## Enhancement

### Cognitive Training
- **Working Memory Training**: Capacity building
- **Inhibition Training**: Control strengthening
- **Strategy Training**: Skill development

### Lifestyle Factors
- **Physical Exercise**: Enhances executive function
- **Meditation**: Improves attention and control
- **Sleep**: Critical for executive performance
