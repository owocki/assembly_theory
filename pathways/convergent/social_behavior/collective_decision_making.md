# Collective Decision Making: Convergent Group Intelligence

## Overview

Collective decision making represents a fundamental convergent assembly that emerges whenever groups of individuals must coordinate their behavior around shared choices. This sophisticated information processing system has independently evolved across countless social species, from bacterial biofilms to primate societies, demonstrating universal principles of information aggregation, consensus formation, and democratic coordination that often produce decisions superior to those made by individuals alone.
