# Eusociality: The Ultimate Social Assembly

## Overview

Eusociality represents the most extreme form of convergent social evolution, characterized by reproductive division of labor, overlapping generations, and cooperative care of young. This extraordinary social assembly has evolved independently at least 15 times across diverse lineages, creating superorganisms whose collective capabilities rival or exceed those of complex multicellular organisms. The assembly index of eusocial systems ranges from 10 million to over 1 billion, representing some of the most complex biological organizations on Earth.
