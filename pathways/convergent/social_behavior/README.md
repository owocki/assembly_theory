# Convergent Assembly Pathways: Social Behavior

## Overview

Social behavior represents one of the most widespread and successful convergent assembly patterns in biological systems. From wolf packs to ant colonies, from fish schools to primate troops, social organization has independently evolved hundreds of times across diverse lineages. This convergent pattern demonstrates how group living and coordinated behavior emerge as optimal solutions to environmental challenges, creating assemblies with emergent properties that transcend individual capabilities.
