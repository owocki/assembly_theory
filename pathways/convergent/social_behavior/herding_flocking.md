# Herding and Flocking: Convergent Collective Movement

## Overview

Herding and flocking represent one of the most widespread convergent assemblies in animal behavior, appearing independently across vertebrates in terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments. These collective movement patterns emerge from simple local interaction rules, creating complex group dynamics that provide protection, navigation efficiency, and information sharing benefits far exceeding individual capabilities.

## Assembly Characteristics

**Core Components**
- Self-organizing group movement
- Synchronized motion without central control
- Information propagation through group
- Collective decision-making for direction
- Anti-predator dilution and confusion effects
- Emergent navigation and foraging benefits

**Assembly Index**: 100000-10000000
- Basic aggregations: AI 100000-500000
- Coordinated movement: AI 500000-2000000
- Complex flocking: AI 2000000-10000000

## Mathematical Foundation

### Boids Model (Reynolds 1987)
**Three Universal Rules**
1. **Separation**: Avoid crowding neighbors
2. **Alignment**: Match velocity with neighbors
3. **Cohesion**: Move toward center of neighbors

**Assembly Emergence**: Complex patterns from simple rules
- No leader required
- Scale-free behavior
- Critical phase transitions
- Emergent order from local interactions

### Information Transfer
```
Information Speed vs Group Dynamics:
Individual reaction time: 100-500ms
Group propagation: 50-150ms (faster than individuals)
Cascade amplification: 10-50ms per individual
Global group response: 200-2000ms
```
