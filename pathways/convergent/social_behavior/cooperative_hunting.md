# Cooperative Hunting: Convergent Predatory Assembly

## Overview

Cooperative hunting represents a sophisticated convergent assembly that has independently evolved across numerous predatory lineages. This behavioral complex involves coordinated group actions to capture prey that would be difficult or impossible for individuals to obtain alone. The assembly demonstrates how collective intelligence, role specialization, and synchronized behavior create emergent hunting capabilities that far exceed the sum of individual efforts.
