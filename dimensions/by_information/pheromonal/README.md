# Pheromonal Information Assembly Dimension

## Overview

Pheromonal information represents one of the most ancient and widespread forms of chemical communication in biological systems. This assembly dimension encompasses the production, transmission, detection, and interpretation of chemical signals that coordinate behavior, reproduction, and social organization across vast phylogenetic distances. From bacterial quorum sensing to mammalian territorial marking, pheromonal systems demonstrate convergent solutions for information transfer in chemical space.
