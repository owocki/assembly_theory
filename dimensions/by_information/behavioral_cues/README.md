# Behavioral Cues Information Assembly Dimension

## Overview

Behavioral cues represent a rich dimension of information assembly where actions, movements, postures, and displays convey complex information between individuals and across species. This non-verbal communication system has convergently evolved across virtually all animal lineages, creating sophisticated information networks that coordinate social behavior, reproductive activities, territorial interactions, and survival responses through visual, acoustic, and mechanical signals.
